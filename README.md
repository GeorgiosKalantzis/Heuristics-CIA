# A Heuristic Approach towards Continuous Implicit Authentication
Smartphones nowadays handle large amounts of sensitive user information, since users exchange undisclosed information on an everyday basis. This generates the need for
more effective authentication mechanisms, deviating from
the traditional ones. In this direction, many research approaches are targeted towards continuous implicit authentication, on the basis of modelling the constant interaction
of the user with the device. These approaches yield promising results, however certain improvements can be made by
exploiting the sequential order of the predictions and the
known performance metrics. In this work, we propose a
heuristics algorithm, which, given a series of predictions
from any continuous implicit authentication model, can exploit the sequential order in order to fix any false predictions and improve the accuracy of the smartphone security
system. Preliminary evaluation on several axes indicates
that our approach can effectively improve any CIA model
and achieve significantly better results.
